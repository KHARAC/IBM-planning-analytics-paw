**Welcome to the IBM-Planning-Analytics-PAW Repository! 🎉📊**

Hello, cube enthusiasts! You've just stumbled into the magical realm of IBM Planning Analytics (PAW), where TurboIntegrator (TI) scripts and Rules collide to create a beautiful symphony of data-driven awesomeness. 🎶✨

If you love data transformations, automated processes, and occasionally yelling at your screen when your cube calculations don’t work (don't worry, we've all been there), then you're in the right place! 🧙‍♂️

What's This Repository About? 🤔
This repository is home to a collection of my TurboIntegrator (TI) scripts and rules used in IBM Planning Analytics Workspace (PAW). It’s a place where I share my best practices, fancy tricks, and sometimes-quirky data solutions with the world. It's like my digital playground—except it’s better because I don't have to clean up the toys! 🧸✨

Here’s what you’ll find:

Data Import Scripts: From CSV to SQL, I’ve got the imports to make your data flow smoother than your morning coffee. ☕📥
Data Validation and Transformation: I’ve written some magical scripts that will clean up your data like your mom cleans your room. 🧹
Business Logic Rules: Because who doesn’t love a good business rule that makes your cube calculations finally work? 🧮
Automation & Scheduling: TI processes that run faster than a toddler on a sugar rush. 🏃💨
Example Projects: Real-world examples of how to use these scripts for everything from budgeting to forecasting... because who doesn’t like a dashboard that actually tells you something useful? 💡📊
